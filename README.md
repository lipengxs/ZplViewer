## Newly Launched ZPL Viewer Tool Website

Hello everyone!

In our work, we often need to design and preview ZPL (Zebra Programming Language) files. Previously, I used tools like ZPL Design, but I thought an online tool would be more convenient. So, I took some time to develop an online ZPL preview tool, hoping it can help those with similar needs.

### Website Features

The newly launched ZPL Viewer website (address: [https://zplpreview.com](https://zplpreview.com)) offers the following features:

- **Online ZPL File Preview**: Preview ZPL files directly in your browser to ensure labels and barcodes are correctly formatted before printing.
- **ZPL Conversion Tools**:
  - **HTML to ZPL**
  - **PDF to ZPL**
  - **Image to ZPL**
- **Download Features**:
  - Convert the previewed ZPL to an image or PDF file for download.

### How to Use

#### Online ZPL Preview

1. Open the website: [https://zplpreview.com](https://zplpreview.com)
2. Enter or paste the ZPL code into the text area.
3. Select print density: 6 dpmm (152 dpi), 8 dpmm (203 dpi), 12 dpmm (300 dpi), 24 dpmm (600 dpi).
4. Click the "Preview" button to view the result.
